## Introduction to source control

Introduction

You can think of source control as an essential everyday practice. Versioning is a standard part of the developer's routine and, if used correctly, can save organizations enormous costs and resources.

The source control is a common-sense aspect of programming. It is essential from time to time to look at why we do what we do and how versioning impacts the entire value stream at an organization.

This module introduces you to the basics of source control, exploring benefits and best practices.

#### Learning objectives
After completing this module, students and professionals can:

- Understand source control.
- Apply best practices for source control.
- Describe the benefits of using source control.

#### Prerequisites

Understanding of what DevOps is and its concepts.
Familiarity with version control principles is helpful but is not necessary.
Beneficial to have experience in an organization that delivers software.

Version control is essential for all software development projects and is vital at large businesses and enterprises.

Enterprises have many stakeholders. For example:

- Distributed teams.
- Strict processes and workflows.
- Siloed organizations.
- Hierarchical organizations.

All those characteristics represent coordination and integration challenges when it comes to merging and deploying code.

Companies within highly regulated industries need a practical way to ensure that all standards 
are met appropriately and mitigate risk—for example, banking and healthcare.

### What is source control?

A Source control system (or version control system) allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes.
Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. 
Source control is an essential tool for multi-developer projects.

The version control system saves a snapshot of your files (history) so that you can review and 
even roll back to any version of your code with ease.
Also, it helps to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.

For most software teams, the source code is a repository of invaluable knowledge and 
understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort.

Source control protects source code from catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.

Without version control, you're tempted to keep multiple copies of code on your computer. It could be dangerous. Easy to change or delete a file in the wrong code copy, potentially losing work.

Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of your code but presenting you with a single version at a time.

Tools and processes alone aren't enough to accomplish the above, such as adopting Agile, Continuous Integration, and DevOps. Believe it or not, all rely on a solid version control practice.

Version control is about keeping track of every change to software assets—tracking and managing the who, what, and when. Version control is the first step needed to assure quality at the source, ensure flow and pull value, and focus on the process. All of these create value not just for the software teams but ultimately for the customer.

Version control is a solution for managing and saving changes made to any manually created assets. If changes are made to the source code, you can go back in time and easily roll back to previous-working versions.

Version control tools will enable you to see who made changes, when, and what exactly was changed.

Version control also makes experimenting easy and, most importantly, makes collaboration possible. Without version control, collaborating over source code would be a painful operation.

There are several perspectives on version control.

For developers, it's a daily enabler for work and collaboration to happen. It's part of the daily job, one of the most-used tools.

For management, the critical value of version control is in:

IP security.
Risk management.
Time-to-market speed through Continuous Delivery, where version control is a fundamental enabler.

"Code does not exist unless it is committed into source control. Source control is the fundamental enabler of continuous delivery."

Whether writing code professionally or personally, you should always version your code using a source control management system. Some of the advantages of using source control are,

- Create workflows. Version control workflows prevent the chaos of everyone using their development process with different and incompatible tools. 
  Version control systems provide process enforcement and permissions, so everyone stays on the same page.
- Work with versions. Every version has a description in the form of a comment. 
  These descriptions help you follow changes in your code by version instead of by individual file changes. Code stored in versions can be viewed and restored from version control at any time as needed. It makes it easy to base new work on any version of code.
- Collaboration. Version control synchronizes versions and makes sure that your changes do not conflict with other changes from your team. Your team relies on version control to help resolve and prevent conflicts, even when people make changes simultaneously.
- Maintains history of changes. Version control keeps a record of changes as your team saves new versions of your code. This history can be reviewed to find out who, why, and when changes were made. The history gives you the confidence to experiment since you can roll back to a previous good version at any time. The history lets your base work from any code version, such as fixing a bug in an earlier release.
- Automate tasks. Version control automation features save your team time and generate consistent results. Automate testing, code analysis, and deployment when new versions are saved to version control.

### Common software development values
- Reusability – why do the same thing twice? Reuse of code is a common practice and makes building on existing assets simpler.
- Traceability – Audits are not just for fun; in many industries, it is a legal matter. All activities must be traced, and managers can produce reports when needed. Traceability also makes debugging and identifying root cause easier. Additionally, it helps with feature reuse as developers can link requirements to implementation.
- Manageability – Can team leaders define and enforce workflows, review rules, create quality gates and enforce QA throughout the lifecycle?
- Efficiency – are we using the right resources for the job, minimizing time and effort? This one is self-explanatory.
- Collaboration – When teams work together, quality tends to improve. We catch one another's mistakes and can build on each other's strengths.
- Learning – Organizations benefit when they invest in employees learning and growing. It is important for onboarding new team members, 
  the lifelong learning of seasoned members, and the opportunity for workers to contribute to the bottom line and the industry.
