## Describe types of source control systems

Understand centralized source control

Centralized source control systems are based on the idea that there's a single "central" copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server). Programmers will check in (or commit) their changes to this central copy.

"Committing" a change means to record the difference in the central system. Other programmers can then see this change.

Also, it's possible to pull down the change. The version control tool will automatically update the contents of any files that were changed.

Most modern version control systems deal with "changesets," which are a group of changes (possibly too many files) that should be treated as a cohesive whole.

Programmers no longer must keep many copies of files on their hard drives manually. The version control tool can talk to the central copy and retrieve any version they need on the fly.

Some of the most common-centralized version control systems you may have heard of or used are Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC), CVS, Subversion (or SVN), and Perforce.

A typical centralized source control workflow
If working with a centralized source control system, your workflow for adding a new feature or fixing a bug in your project will usually look something like this:

- Get the latest changes other people have made from the central server.
- Make your changes, and make sure they work correctly.
- Check in your changes to the main server so that other programmers can see them.


## Explore Git and Team Foundation Version Control

### Git (distributed)
Git is a distributed version control system. Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their development system. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine.

Branches are lightweight. When you need to switch contexts, you can create a private local branch. You can quickly switch from one branch to another to pivot among different variations of your codebase. Later, you can merge, publish, or dispose of the branch.

- Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC-centralized)
- Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) is a centralized version control system.

Typically, team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Branches are path-based and created on the server.

#### TFVC has two workflow models:

Server workspaces - Before making changes, team members publicly check out files. Most operations require developers to be connected to the server. This system helps lock workflows. Other software that works this way includes Visual Source Safe, Perforce, and CVS. You can scale up to huge codebases with millions of files per branchâ€”also, large binary files with server workspaces.

Local workspaces - Each team member copies the latest codebase version with them and works offline as needed. Developers check in their changes and resolve conflicts as necessary. Another system that works this way is Subversion.

## Describe working with Git locally

Git and Continuous Delivery is one of those delicious chocolate and peanut butter combinations. We occasionally find two great tastes that taste great together in the software world!

Continuous Delivery of software demands a significant level of automation. It is hard to deliver continuously if you do not have a quality codebase.

Git provides you with the building blocks to take charge of quality in your codebase. It allows you to automate most of the checks in your codebase.

Also, it works before committing the code into your repository.

To fully appreciate the effectiveness of Git, you must first understand how to carry out basic operations on Git. For example, clone, commit, push, and pull.

The natural question is, how do we get started with Git?

One option is to go native with the command line or look for a code editor that supports Git natively.

Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform, open-source code editor that provides powerful developer tooling for hundreds of languages.

To work in open-source, you need to embrace open-source tools.

This recipe will start by:

- Setting up the development environment with Visual Studio Code.
- Creating a new Git repository.
- Committing code changes locally.
- Pushing changes to a remote repository on Azure DevOps.

## Getting ready
This tutorial will teach us how to initialize a Git repository locally.

Then we will use the ASP.NET Core MVC project template to create a new project and version it in the local Git repository.

We will then use Visual Studio Code to interact with the Git repository to do basic commit, pull, and push operations
