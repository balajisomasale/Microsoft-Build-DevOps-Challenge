## Introduction to GitHub Projects and Project boards

### Project Boards

During the application or project lifecycle, it's crucial to plan and prioritize work.
With Project boards, you can control specific feature work, roadmaps, release plans, etc.

Project boards are made up of issues, pull requests, and 
notes categorized as cards you can drag and drop into your chosen columns. 
The cards contain relevant metadata for issues and pull requests, like labels, assignees, the status, and who opened it.

There are different types of project boards:

- User-owned project boards: Can contain issues and pull requests from any personal repository.
- Organization-wide project boards: Can contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization.
- Repository project boards: Are scoped to issues and pull requests within a single repository.
- To create a project board for your organization, you must be an organization member.

It's possible to use templates to set up a new project board that will include columns and cards with tips.
The templates can be automated and already configured.
