Introduction

"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." - According to Donovan Brown in What is DevOps?

The DevOps learning paths will help you prepare for a DevOps journey. You'll learn the main characteristics of the DevOps process, tools, and people involved during the lifecycle. Also, it prepares you for the Microsoft DevOps Solution certification exam. You'll see other content to ensure you have a complete picture of DevOps. The module's content includes graphics, reference links, module review questions, and optional hands-on labs.

You'll learn the following:

How to plan for DevOps.
Use source control.
Scale Git for an enterprise.
Combine artifacts.
Design a dependency management strategy.
Manage secrets.
Implement continuous integration.
Implement a container-build strategy.
Design a release strategy.
Set up a release management workflow.
Implement a deployment pattern.
Optimize feedback mechanisms.
Plan before you act. This module will help you understand what DevOps is and how to plan for a DevOps transformation journey.

#### What is the DevOps transformation journey?

The DevOps transformation journey is a series of 9 learning paths. It familiarizes you with Azure DevOps and GitHub. Also, learn its many services, features, and integration with tools to support your DevOps process.

#### Why should I take the DevOps learning path?

People in these modules are interested in designing and implementing DevOps processes. Also, they're preparing for the AZ-400 - Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions certification exam https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-400 

The certification exam is for DevOps professionals. Combine people, processes, and technologies to continuously deliver valuable products and services that meet end-user needs and business goals. DevOps professionals streamline delivery by optimizing practices, improving communications and collaboration, and creating automation.

They design and implement application code and infrastructure strategies that allow continuous integration, testing, delivery, monitoring, and feedback.

Exam candidates must be proficient with Agile practices. They must be familiar with Azure administration, development and experts in at least one of these areas.

DevOps professionals must design and implement DevOps practices for version control, compliance, infrastructure as code, configuration management, build, release, and testing-using Azure technologies.

There are five domain areas.

AZ-400 Domain Area	Weight
- Configure Processes and Communications.	13%
- Design and Implement Source Control.	19%
- Design and Implement Build and Release Pipelines.	42%
- Develop a Security and Compliance Plan.	14%
- Implement an Instrumentation Strategy.	13%

Instructor-led course: AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals.
If you're new to Azure Administration, consider taking the:

Free online: Prerequisites for Azure Administrators.
Instructor-led courses: AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator.
If you're new to Azure Developer, consider taking the:

#### Free online: Create serverless applications.
Instructor-led courses: AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure and AZ-020: Microsoft Azure Solutions for AWS Developers.
You must create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project for some exercises. If you don't have it yet, see the following:

#### Create an organization - Azure DevOps.
If you already have your organization created, use the Azure DevOps Demo Generator [https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net] and create a new Team Project called "Parts Unlimited" using the template "PartsUnlimited." Or feel free to create a blank project. See Create a project - Azure DevOps.
You must create a GitHub account at GitHub.com and a project for some exercises. If you don't have it yet, see the following:
